# SAT-features

Python library to extract features from SAT problems. Re-production of SATzilla feature extractor.

Features implemented:
1-48. of Satzilla paper (see [features](documentation/features.md)).

Fractal dimension of CVIG and VIG, modularity of VIG, and alpha (powerlaw fit of variable occurrences) from Structure Features for SAT instances classification.

Current command line usage, from project root directory.
This will print a dictionary of the features. Abbreviations can be found in (see [features](documentation/features.md)). [TO DO].
```
python features.py path/to/cnf_file.cnf
```

N.b. current implementation reliant on SatELite binaries, which only work on linux systems.

**Dependencies**
- NetworkX:  ```pip install networkx```
- community ```pip install python-louvain```
- powerlaw ```pip install powerlaw```
- sklearn ```pip install scikit-learn```

A binary for ubcsat is included in the ubcsat folder, however you may have to compile and add this yourself for full functionality.
Please clone and compile [ubcsat](https://github.com/dtompkins/ubcsat/tree/beta), and put the resulting binary in the ubcsat folder, if the current binary does not work. We found the beta branch to be stable.
